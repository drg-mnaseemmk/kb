# Healthbase Knowledgebase

This knowledgebase will help you get comfortable with the healthbase products. However you choose to access the data, the documentation and examples here will introduce you to accessing them so you can get started.

## What does the database look like?
The best way to do this is to use the [Schema Browser](https://healthbase.compile.com/schema). The Schema Browser will show you all the tables in the system and what data they contain. For eg., the entry on the [affiliations](https://healthbase.compile.com/schema#affiliations) table will tell you that it has fields such as `node_1_id` (an `IntegerField`) and `node_2_id`. It will also indicate that `node_2_id` points to IDs in tables such as `hospital` and `healthsystem`. 

# Navigating the Knowledgebase
You can check out the different articles on the Knowledgebase by clicking on the tabs at the top of the page. These cover important topics that help you understand [Affiliations](/affiliations/), [using the various affiliation tables](/use_cases/) and so on.

# Changelog
Use the [Healthbase Changelog](https://gethealthbase.com/schema/changelog/) to keep up-to-date with changes in the Healthbase schema. All major changes will be documented for every release. You can keep track of newly added tables, changes to existing tables and other features.
